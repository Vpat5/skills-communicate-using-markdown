According to all known laws of aviation,
# there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
## Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
### The bee, of course, flies anyway
#### because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
##### Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
###### Ooh, black and yellow!
